# [Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mesosphere/marathon.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mesosphere/marathon)

Marathon is an [Apache Mesos][Mesos] framework for long-running applications. Given that
you have Mesos running as the kernel for your datacenter, Marathon is the
[`init`][init] or [`upstart`][upstart] daemon.

Marathon provides a
[REST API](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/rest-api.html) for
starting, stopping, and scaling applications. Marathon is written in Scala and
can run in highly-available mode by running multiple copies. The
state of running tasks gets stored in the Mesos state abstraction.

Try Marathon now on AWS with [Elastic Mesos](http://elastic.mesosphere.io) or with [Mesosphere for Google Compute Platform](http://google.mesosphere.io) and learn how
to use it in Mesosphere's interactive
[Marathon tutorial](http://mesosphere.com/learn/run-services-with-marathon/)
that can be personalized for your cluster.

Marathon is a *meta framework*: you can start other Mesos frameworks such as
Chronos or [Storm][Storm] with it to ensure they survive machine failures.
It can launch anything that can be launched in a standard shell. In fact, you
can even start other Marathon instances via Marathon.

Using Marathon versions 0.7.0+ and Mesos 0.20.0+, you can [deploy, run and scale Docker containers](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/native-docker.html) with ease.

Documentation for installing and configuring the full Mesosphere stack with Mesos + Marathon is
available on the [Mesosphere website](http://mesosphere.com/docs/).

## Features

* *HA* -- run any number of Marathon schedulers, but only one gets elected as
    leader; if you access a non-leader, your request gets proxied to the
    current leader
* *[Constraints](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/constraints.html)* - e.g., only one instance of an application per rack, node, etc.
* *[Service Discovery &amp; Load Balancing](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/service-discovery-load-balancing.html)* via HAProxy or the events API (see below).
* *[Health Checks](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/health-checks.html)*: check your application's health via HTTP or TCP checks.
* *[Event Subscription](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/rest-api.html#event-subscriptions)* lets you supply an HTTP endpoint to receive notifications, for example to integrate with an external load balancer.
* *Web UI*
* *[JSON/REST API](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/rest-api.html)* for easy integration and scriptability
* *Basic Auth* and *SSL*
* *Metrics*: available at `/metrics` in JSON format

## Setting Up And Running Marathon

### Installation

#### Install Mesos

Marathon requires Mesos installed on the same machine in order to use a shared library.
One easy way is via your system's package manager.
Current builds for major Linux distributions are available
from on the Mesosphere [downloads page](http://mesosphere.com/downloads/)
or from Mesosphere's [repositories](http://mesosphere.com/2014/07/17/mesosphere-package-repositories/).

If building from source, see the
Mesos [Getting Started](http://mesos.apache.org/gettingstarted/) page or the
[Mesosphere tutorial](http://mesosphere.com/2013/08/01/distributed-fault-tolerant-framework-apache-mesos/)
for details. Running `make install` will install Mesos in `/usr/local` in
the same way as these packages do.

#### Install Marathon

Full instructions on how to install prepackaged releases are available [in the Marathon docs](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/). Alternatively, you can build Marathon from source.

##### Building from Source

1.  To build Marathon from source, check out this repo and use sbt to build a JAR:

        git clone https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon.git
        cd marathon
        sbt assembly

1.  Run `./bin/build-distribution` to package Marathon as an
    [executable JAR](http://mesosphere.com/2013/12/07/executable-jars/)
    (optional).

### Running in Development Mode

Mesos local mode allows you to run Marathon without launching a full Mesos
cluster. It is meant for experimentation and not recommended for production
use. Note that you still need to run ZooKeeper for storing state. The following
command launches Marathon on Mesos in *local mode*. Point your web browser to
`http://localhost:8080` to see the Marathon UI.

    ./bin/start --master local --zk zk://localhost:2181/marathon

For more information on how to run Marathon in production and configuration
options, see [the Marathon docs](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/).

## Developing Marathon

The [Marathon Project Docs](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/contributing.html)
contains documentation on simplifying local development and testing of Marathon
including how to run a Mesos environment inside a preconfigured virtual machine
and a list of recipes for launching applications that test specific Marathon
features.

### Running the development Docker

Build tip:

    docker build -t marathon-tip .

Run it:

    docker run marathon-tip --master local --zk zk://localhost:2181/marathon

If you want to inspect the contents of the Docker:

    docker run -i -t --entrypoint=/bin/bash marathon-tip -s
